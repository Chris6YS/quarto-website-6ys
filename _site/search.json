    "text": "Outbursts of emotions in football are common and can be observed by watching players, managers, supporters, and even referees. The emotions revealed at tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup are visible in many situations. On this international stage, the playing of national anthems prior to kick-off frequently evokes strong expressions of emotions and, for some, may represent a unique affect driven experience.\n\n\n\n\nLA EMOCI√ìN DE ALEXIS VEGA EN SU PRIMER MUNDIAL üá≤üáΩ ‚ù§#Qatar2022 #FIFAWorldCup pic.twitter.com/FJh64baa8h\n\n‚Äî ESPN.com.mx ((ESPNmx?)) November 22, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe circumplex model of emotion developed by James Russell (Russell 1980) is a commonly cited framework for defining dimensions of affective states (Remington, Fabrigar, and Visser 2000).1 This model suggests that emotional states are processed and represented along the two dimensions of valence (horizontal axis) and arousal/activity (vertical axis) (Scott, Sauter, and McGettigan 2010) (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Russell's 2 dimensional model of emotions. Adapted from Russell (1980)\n\n\n\n\nResearch investigating the interaction of emotions and music is vast (Juslin 2013). Many models have been proposed (Eerola and Vuoskoski 2010) and interest in the study of emotions and music recommendation systems is growing (Schedl et al. 2018). Metrics similar to Russell‚Äôs dimensions are found in Spotify‚Äôs track audio features 2. Spotify defines their valence and energy (a proxy for arousal) measures as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValence:\n\n\n\n‚ÄúA measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g.¬†happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g.¬†sad, depressed, angry).‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy:\n\n\n\n‚ÄúEnergy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.‚Äù\n\n\nUsing the Spotifyr package (Thompson et al. 2021), Spotify audio features of valence and energy for the 32 national anthems of the participating countries at the 2022 FIFA Men‚Äôs World Cup were plotted with ggplot2 (Wickham 2016). This descriptive analysis is not without limitations. For example, results can vary depending on each artists‚Äô interpretation of the song. That being said, the current analysis‚Äô results are shown in Figure 2 below. Does Wales‚Äô anthem strike a miserable nerve? Can we explain England‚Äôs bore draw tendencies via their low energy score? Conversely, did Costa Rica concede seven to Spain because their anthem is too energetic? To be clear, I don‚Äôt actually believe any of this relates to performance on the pitch, these are just some of my silly thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

    "text": "The Relative Age Effect (RAE) is a commonly observed phenomenon within different sports whereby individuals born earlier in a selection period are overrepresented within their cohort, whilst those born later relative to their peers are underrepresented (Cobley et al., 2009). The RAE constitutes a complex selection bias, as a result of confounding sporting ability and potential with a host of chronological age related factors in the physical (M√ºller et al., 2018), cognitive (Jakobsson et al., 2021) and socio-emotional (Thompson et al., 2004) domains of maturation.\nThe RAE has been observed across different playing levels of soccer from youth academies (Jackson & Comber, 2020) to professional tiers (G√∂tze & Hoppe, 2021), with the magnitude of the effect usually larger in younger cohorts (Pedersen et al., 2022a). Moreover, it appears that the RAE may be more pronounced in male players (Smith et al., 2018), whilst studies involving the RAE within the context of female sports are less prevalent and conclusions are often mixed (Cobley et al., 2009). For example, Korgaokar et al. (2018) found RAE within their sample of female players, whereas Andrew et al. (2022) were unable to consistently demonstrate this effect in their study.\nThe aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of the RAE in players historically selected for Canada Soccer national team programs, including training camps, across playing levels and gender. It was hypothesized that the RAE would be present in the U15, U17 and U20 programs, but not in the U23 or senior levels. It was also hypothesized that the magnitude of the effect would be largest in the youngest level (U15) and it would be more pronounced in the male programs compared to the female programs."

    "text": "2 Methods\n\n2.1 Sample\nAn apriori analysis using G*Power version 3.1.9.7 (Faul et al., 2007) was used for sample size estimation. Using 95% power for detecting a medium effect (Cohen‚Äôs \\omega= .3), at a significance criterion of Œ± = .05, the required minimum sample size for a Chi-Square goodness-of-fit analysis is 191.\nPlayers that were selected for a Canada Soccer national team program training camp or official competition roster for which birth month data was available were included in the sample. Including participants who were selected for training camps as well as competitions allowed for an increased sample size. This information was obtained from Canada Soccer (2022), FIFA (2022) and CONCACAF (2022). The final sample includes 3809 players from 9 national team programs (see Table 1). The senior Men‚Äôs national team program data included was from 1986 to 2022 only. Although information was available beginning from 1885 for this specific program, the period preceding 1986 was excluded from the current analysis, mainly for ease of comparison between the senior Men‚Äôs and senior Women/X‚Äôs programs. There was no U23 Women‚Äôs program, as such, the U23 Men‚Äôs program is the only one included for this age group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1\n    \n\nSummary of Program Samples\n    \n\n\nProgram\n      n\n      Period\n    \n\n\nU15 Boys\n685\n1997-2022\n\n\nU15 Girls\n213\n2004-2022\n\n\nU17 Boys\n542\n1990-2022\n\n\nU17 Girls\n423\n2000-2022\n\n\nU20 Men\n709\n1973-2022\n\n\nU20 Women\n294\n2002-2022\n\n\nU23 Men\n330\n1990-2022\n\n\nSenior Men1\n\n366\n1986-2022\n\n\nSenior Women/X\n247\n1986-2022\n\n\n\n\n1 Excludes period before 1986.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Relative Age Classification\nThe birth month of each player was categorized into quartiles. The quartiles were defined by using a January 1st cut-off date. The year was divided into the following four quarters: Quarter 1 = January, February, March; Quarter 2 = April, May, June; Quarter 3 = July, August, September; Quarter 4 = October, November, December.\n\n2.3 Statistical Analysis\nChi-Square (\\chi^2) goodness-of-fit tests were used to compare the observed and expected birth month quarter distributions (Equation¬†1).\n\n\n\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac {(O - E)^2}{E} \\tag{1}\n\n\n\nWhere: O = observed valueE = expected value \n\n\nStatistical significance criterion was set at p < 0.05. Effect sizes for the Chi-Square tests reaching significance were calculated with Cohen‚Äôs \\omega, with strength of the effect interpreted as small = 0.1, medium = 0.3 and large = 0.5 (Cohen, 1992). The expected birth month and quarter distributions were calculated from the reference population of births in Canada obtained from Statistics Canada (2022). The population birthdate quartile percentages were 24.05 (Quater 1), 25.67 (Quarter 2), 26.27 (Quarter 3) and 24.01 (Quarter 4) respectively.\nPost-hoc analyses were conducted by calculating standardized residuals and Odds Ratios (ORs) (Sharpe, 2015). ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare Quarter 1 to Quarter 4 (Equation¬†2).\n\n\nOR = \\frac {a/c}{b/d} = \\frac {ad}{bc} \\tag{2}\n\n\n\nWhere: a = observed value group 1b = observed value group 2 c = expected value group 1 d = expected value group 2\n\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R Statistical Software version 4.2.2 (Mangiafico, 2023; R Core Team, 2022). Tables were produced with the gt (Iannone et al., 2022) and gtExtras (Mock, 2022) packages. Figures were produced with the ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), showtext (Qiu & details., 2022) and ggtext (Wilke & Wiernik, 2022) packages."

    "text": "4 Discussion\nThe present study investigated the RAE prevalence in players historically selected for Canada Soccer national team programs including training camps. The main findings are: (1) The RAE was present within both U15, U17 and U20 programs of the sample; (2) The RAE was present within the Senior Women/X‚Äôs program but not within the Senior Men‚Äôs or U23 Men‚Äôs programs of the sample; (3) The magnitude of the effect sizes decreased with an increase in age of the program samples; (4) The effect sizes for both U15 programs were similar in magnitude; (5) The effect sizes for both U17 programs were also similar in magnitude; (6) The effect size for the U20 Women‚Äôs program was stronger than that of the U20 Men‚Äôs program.\nThe current study‚Äôs findings for the male programs are in line with several other studies which indicate that the RAE is a common occurrence in these categories worldwide and tends to decrease with an increase in age (Brustio et al., 2018; Lupo et al., 2019). Additionally, the absence of a significant RAE in the Senior Men‚Äôs program of the study‚Äôs sample is consistent with other past findings (Andrew et al., 2022; G√∂tze & Hoppe, 2021).\nHowever, for the girls‚Äô and women‚Äôs programs, the current study‚Äôs results that show persistent and significant RAE across all categories are only partially consistent with previous literature (Delorme et al., 2009; G√∂tze & Hoppe, 2021; Simon et al., 2022). For example, Barreira et al. (2021) failed to establish the presence of a RAE in a sample of women‚Äôs national team players participating in the Olympic games from 1996 through 2016. However, Sedano et al. (2015) demonstrated a significant RAE among Spanish players at different playing levels including the national team. The current study‚Äôs results are also in line with those of Korgaokar et al. (2018) who found consistent RAE within their sample of girls competing at different levels in the USA, with effect sizes decreasing with an increase in age.\nOne surprising finding from the current study is the stronger presence of RAE within the U20 Women‚Äôs program compared to the U20 Men‚Äôs. This is an unusual pattern that is not consistent with what is typically reported in the current literature (Baker et al., 2009).\nThere is evidence to suggest that the RAE may be influenced by region specific variables (Romann & Fuchslocher, 2013). As the RAE is theorized by some to be typically stronger in sports that are the more popular (Cobley et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2018), it is possible that the RAE may be most present in countries where soccer participation for girls and women is higher (Korgaokar et al., 2018; Simon et al., 2022). However, the manifestation of the RAE is likely a non-linear interaction of multiple moderating variables (Baker et al., 2009; Schorer et al., 2015).\nCanada represents a competitive landscape for girls‚Äô and women‚Äôs soccer, with over 200 000 registered female players (Canada Soccer Association, 2022; FIFA, 2019). In spite of that, Canada represents one of the only top ranked FIFA nations without a currently active domestic professional women‚Äôs league. It could be hypothesized that this unique regional condition may be favourable to promoting and sustaining the RAE.

    "text": "The Relative Age Effect (RAE) is a commonly observed phenomenon within different sports whereby individuals born earlier in a selection period are overrepresented within their cohort, whilst those born later relative to their peers are underrepresented (Cobley et al., 2009). The RAE constitutes a complex selection bias, as a result of confounding sporting ability and potential with a host of chronological age related factors in the physical (M√ºller et al., 2018), cognitive (Jakobsson et al., 2021) and socio-emotional (Thompson et al., 2004) domains of maturation.\nThe RAE has been observed across different playing levels of soccer from youth academies (Jackson & Comber, 2020) to professional tiers (G√∂tze & Hoppe, 2021), with the magnitude of the effect usually larger in younger cohorts (Pedersen et al., 2022). Moreover, it appears that the RAE may be more pronounced in male players (Smith et al., 2018), whilst studies involving the RAE within the context of female sports are less prevalent and conclusions are often mixed (Cobley et al., 2009). For example, Korgaokar et al. (2018) found RAE within their sample of female players, whereas Andrew et al. (2022) were unable to consistently demonstrate this effect in their study.\nThe aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of the RAE in players historically selected for Canada Soccer national team programs, including training camps, across playing levels and gender. It was hypothesized that the RAE would be present in the U15, U17 and U20 programs, but not in the U23 or senior levels. It was also hypothesized that the magnitude of the effect would be largest in the youngest level (U15) and it would be more pronounced in the male programs compared to the female programs."

    "text": "2 Methods\n\n2.1 Sample\nAn apriori analysis using G*Power version 3.1.9.7 (Faul et al., 2007) was used for sample size estimation. Using 95% power for detecting a medium effect (Cohen‚Äôs \\omega= .3), at a significance criterion of Œ± = .05, the required minimum sample size for a Chi-Square goodness-of-fit analysis is 191.\nPlayers that were selected for a Canada Soccer national team program training camp or official competition roster for which birth month data was available were included in the sample. Including participants who were selected for training camps as well as competitions allowed for an increased sample size. This information was obtained from Canada Soccer (2022), FIFA (2022) and CONCACAF (2022). The final sample includes 3809 players from 9 national team programs (see Table 1). The senior Men‚Äôs national team program data included was from 1986 to 2022 only. Although information was available beginning from 1885 for this specific program, the period preceding 1986 was excluded from the current analysis, mainly for ease of comparison between the senior Men‚Äôs and senior Women/X‚Äôs programs. There was no U23 Women‚Äôs program, as such, the U23 Men‚Äôs program is the only one included for this age group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1\n    \n\nSummary of Program Samples\n    \n\n\nProgram\n      n\n      Period\n    \n\n\nU15 Boys\n685\n1997-2022\n\n\nU15 Girls\n213\n2004-2022\n\n\nU17 Boys\n542\n1990-2022\n\n\nU17 Girls\n423\n2000-2022\n\n\nU20 Men\n709\n1973-2022\n\n\nU20 Women\n294\n2002-2022\n\n\nU23 Men\n330\n1990-2022\n\n\nSenior Men1\n\n366\n1986-2022\n\n\nSenior Women/X\n247\n1986-2022\n\n\n\n\n1 Excludes period before 1986.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Relative Age Classification\nThe birth month of each player was categorized into quartiles. The quartiles were defined by using a January 1st cut-off date. The year was divided into the following four quarters: Quarter 1 = January, February, March; Quarter 2 = April, May, June; Quarter 3 = July, August, September; Quarter 4 = October, November, December.\n\n2.3 Statistical Analysis\nChi-Square (\\chi^2) goodness-of-fit tests were used to compare the observed and expected birth month quarter distributions (Equation¬†1).\n\n\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac {(O - E)^2}{E} \\tag{1}\n\n\nWhere: O = observed valueE = expected value \n\n\nStatistical significance criterion was set at p < 0.05. Effect sizes for the Chi-Square tests reaching significance were calculated with Cohen‚Äôs \\omega, with strength of the effect interpreted as small = 0.1, medium = 0.3 and large = 0.5 (Cohen, 1992). The expected birth month and quarter distributions were calculated from the reference population of births in Canada obtained from Statistics Canada (2022). The population birthdate quartile percentages were 24.05 (Quater 1), 25.67 (Quarter 2), 26.27 (Quarter 3) and 24.01 (Quarter 4) respectively.\nPost-hoc analyses were conducted by calculating standardized residuals and Odds Ratios (ORs) (Sharpe, 2015). ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare Quarter 1 to Quarter 4 (Equation¬†2).\n\n\nOR = \\frac {a/c}{b/d} = \\frac {ad}{bc} \\tag{2}\n\n\n\nWhere: a = observed value group 1b = observed value group 2 c = expected value group 1 d = expected value group 2\n\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R Statistical Software version 4.2.2 (Mangiafico, 2023; R Core Team, 2022). Tables were produced with the gt (Iannone et al., 2022) and gtExtras (Mock, 2022) packages. Figures were produced with the ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), showtext (Qiu, 2022) and ggtext (Wilke & Wiernik, 2022) packages."

    "text": "4 Discussion\nThe present study investigated the RAE prevalence in players historically selected for Canada Soccer national team programs including training camps. The main findings are: (1) The RAE was present within both U15, U17 and U20 programs of the sample; (2) The RAE was present within the Senior Women/X‚Äôs program but not within the Senior Men‚Äôs or U23 Men‚Äôs programs of the sample; (3) The magnitude of the effect sizes decreased with an increase in age of the program samples; (4) The effect sizes for both U15 programs were similar in magnitude; (5) The effect sizes for both U17 programs were also similar in magnitude; (6) The effect size for the U20 Women‚Äôs program was stronger than that of the U20 Men‚Äôs program.\nThe current study‚Äôs findings for the male programs are in line with several other studies which indicate that the RAE is a common occurrence in these categories worldwide and tends to decrease with an increase in age (Brustio et al., 2018; Lupo et al., 2019). Additionally, the absence of a significant RAE in the Senior Men‚Äôs program of the study‚Äôs sample is consistent with other past findings (Andrew et al., 2022; G√∂tze & Hoppe, 2021).\nHowever, for the girls‚Äô and women‚Äôs programs, the current study‚Äôs results that show persistent and significant RAE across all categories are only partially consistent with previous literature (Delorme et al., 2009; G√∂tze & Hoppe, 2021; Simon et al., 2022). For example, Barreira et al. (2021) failed to establish the presence of a RAE in a sample of women‚Äôs national team players participating in the Olympic games from 1996 through 2016. However, Sedano et al. (2015) demonstrated a significant RAE among Spanish players at different playing levels including the national team. The current study‚Äôs results are also in line with those of Korgaokar et al. (2018) who found consistent RAE within their sample of girls competing at different levels in the USA, with effect sizes decreasing with an increase in age.\nOne surprising finding from the current study is the stronger presence of RAE within the U20 Women‚Äôs program compared to the U20 Men‚Äôs. This is an unusual pattern that is not consistent with what is typically reported in the current literature (Baker et al., 2009).\nThere is evidence to suggest that the RAE may be influenced by region specific variables (Romann & Fuchslocher, 2013). As the RAE is theorized by some to be typically stronger in sports that are the more popular (Cobley et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2018), it is possible that the RAE may be most present in countries where soccer participation for girls and women is higher (Korgaokar et al., 2018; Simon et al., 2022). However, the manifestation of the RAE is likely a non-linear interaction of multiple moderating variables (Baker et al., 2009; Schorer et al., 2015).\nCanada represents a competitive landscape for girls‚Äô and women‚Äôs soccer, with over 200 000 registered female players (Canada Soccer Association, 2022; FIFA, 2019). In spite of that, Canada represents one of the only top ranked FIFA nations without a currently active domestic professional women‚Äôs league. It could be hypothesized that this unique regional condition may be favourable to promoting and sustaining the RAE. With limited opportunities relative to the size of the player pool available, perhaps causing participation rates to exceed the established infrastructure, inequalities such as the RAE could become more pervasive and sustained over time. This supposition could possibly explain the results of the U20 categories as this age group is a crucial time for professional development. However, this is purely speculative from the author‚Äôs part and requires further investigation.\nResearch on the RAE in soccer is not new (Helsen et al., 2012), however, Pedersen et al. (2022) suggest that the RAE has grown stronger over time with the effect being increasingly present in more recent major tournaments. Since research on women‚Äôs soccer is growing exponentially, investigating the RAE within the girls‚Äô and women‚Äôs soccer context remains relevant, as the literature remains far behind the depth of the boys‚Äôs and men‚Äôs game (Okholm Kryger et al., 2021). The importance of this area of research should be emphasized, as even when direct efforts are made to mitigate the RAE, it may still persist (Lagestad et al., 2018).\n\n4.1 Limitations\nThis study is not without limitations. First, the present study did not include physical, cognitive or psychosocial data. Therefore, assumptions about potential advantages in these areas of maturation for early born players cannot be confirmed in the current sample.\nSecondly, birth months were used to determine birth quarter distributions. This method has limitations as players born on January 1st and March 31st are considered as equivalent. Other statistical methods such as Poisson regression techniques could potentially be considered more appropriate and effective in this context (Doyle & Bottomley, 2019).\nFinally, it should also be cautioned that in some instances, the samples for different programs included different time periods. It is possible that differences in the prevalence of the RAE exist dependent on the time period analysed and comparisons across different periods may limit the reliability of conclusions."
