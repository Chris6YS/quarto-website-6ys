    "text": "Outbursts of emotions in football are common and can be observed by watching players, managers, supporters, and even referees. The emotions revealed at tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup are visible in many situations. On this international stage, the playing of national anthems prior to kick-off frequently evokes strong expressions of emotions and, for some, may represent a unique affect driven experience.\n\n\n\n\nLA EMOCIÓN DE ALEXIS VEGA EN SU PRIMER MUNDIAL 🇲🇽 ❤#Qatar2022 #FIFAWorldCup pic.twitter.com/FJh64baa8h\n\n— ESPN.com.mx ((ESPNmx?)) November 22, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe circumplex model of emotion developed by James Russell (Russell, 1980) is a commonly cited framework for defining dimensions of affective states (Remington et al., 2000).1 This model suggests that emotional states are processed and represented along the two dimensions of valence (horizontal axis) and arousal/activity (vertical axis) (Scott et al., 2010) (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Russell’s 2 dimensional model of emotions. Adapted from Russell (1980)\n\n\n\n\nResearch investigating the interaction of emotions and music is vast (Juslin, 2013). Many models have been proposed (Eerola & Vuoskoski, 2010) and interest in the study of emotions and music recommendation systems is growing (Schedl et al., 2018). Measures similar to Russell’s dimensions are found in Spotify’s track audio features 2. Spotify defines their valence and energy (a proxy for arousal) measures as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValence:\n\n\n\n“A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy:\n\n\n\n“Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.”\n\n\nUsing the Spotifyr package (Thompson et al., 2021), Spotify audio features of valence and energy for the 32 national anthems of the participating countries at the 2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup were plotted via ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016). This descriptive analysis is not without limitations. For example, results can vary depending on each artists’ interpretation of the song. That being said, the current analysis’ results are shown in Figure 2 below. Does Wales’ anthem strike a miserable nerve? Can we explain England’s bore draw tendencies via their low energy score? Conversely, did Costa Rica concede seven to Spain because their anthem is too energetic? To be clear, I don’t actually believe any of this relates to performance on the pitch, these are just some of my silly thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

November 21, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosta Rica’s fans were brilliant and their players belted out the anthem with such passion but it seemed to take all of their intensity out of them.
